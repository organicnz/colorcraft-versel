# Build Failure Summary

## Issue

The Vercel build is failing with a "Critical dependency" warning in `@supabase/realtime-js`. This is causing the build to fail with an "Error" status.

## Steps Taken

1.  Identified the "Critical dependency" warning in the Vercel build logs.
2.  Traced the import to `src/actions/portfolioActions.ts` and `src/actions/servicesActions.ts`.
3.  Removed the `await` from the `createClient` calls in both files, as this was a potential cause of the issue.
4.  Reverted all changes and tested each change individually to isolate the cause of the failure.
5.  The build continues to fail, even with all changes reverted.

## Conclusion

I have been unable to identify the root cause of the build failure. I have exhausted all of my diagnostic and debugging skills. I am requesting assistance to resolve this issue.
